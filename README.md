It appears that the script does not explicitly mention a `requirements.txt` file. To create one, you can list the necessary Python libraries that the script depends on. Here are the steps to generate a `requirements.txt` file:

1. Create a new file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your script.
2. Add the following lines to the `requirements.txt` file:

```
requests
tqdm
```

These are the libraries explicitly used in the script. The script also uses `subprocess`, `re`, and `concurrent.futures`, which are part of the Python standard library and do not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file.

Here is the updated `README.md` including the creation of `requirements.txt`:

# IPTV Playlist Processor

This script processes an IPTV playlist to clean channel names, remove duplicates, sort entries, and check the availability and resolution of the channels.

## Download

Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPTV-Playlist-Processor.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the script file directly from the GitHub repository.

## Preparation

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library: To install, use `pip install requests`
- `tqdm` library: To install, use `pip install tqdm`
- FFmpeg: Follow the [FFmpeg installation guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) appropriate for your operating system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file as mentioned in the [Download](#download) section.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

```bash
cd IPTV-Playlist-Processor
```

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

```txt
requests
tqdm
```

4. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- **Channel Availability Check**: Checks if the IPTV channel URLs are working.
- **Resolution Check**: Determines the resolution of the IPTV channels (FHD, HD, SD).
- **Name Cleaning**: Cleans channel and group names by removing unwanted characters.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Removes duplicate channel entries.
- **Sorting**: Sorts the channels by name and URL.
- **Playlist Formatting**: Formats and writes the processed playlist to an output file.

## Usage

1. Place your input playlist file (`Input Playlist.txt`) in the appropriate directory.
2. Modify the `input_path` and `output_path` variables in the `main` function if necessary.

```python
def main():
    input_path = r'C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\IPTV\\Input Playlist.txt'
    output_path = r'C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\IPTV\\Output Playlist.txt'
    # ... rest of the code
```

3. Run the script.

```bash
python IPTV_Playlist_Processor.py
```

The processed playlist will be saved to the specified `output_path`.
